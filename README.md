# Lane-Line-Detection-using-Classical-Computer-Vision
A computer vision pipeline for detecting lane lines in road images using traditional image processing techniques including color thresholding, region masking, and gradient analysis. Inspired by Udacity’s Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, this project lays the foundation for more advanced deep learning methods like U-Net-based segmentation.

# 🛣️ Lane Line Detection using Classical Computer Vision

This project implements a basic computer vision pipeline to detect lane lines in road images. It uses traditional image processing techniques such as color filtering, region of interest masking, and gradient filtering.
