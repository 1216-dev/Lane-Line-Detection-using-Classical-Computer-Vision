# Lane-Line-Detection-using-Classical-Computer-Vision
A computer vision pipeline for detecting lane lines in road images using traditional image processing techniques including color thresholding, region masking, and gradient analysis. Inspired by Udacityâ€™s Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, this project lays the foundation for more advanced deep learning methods like U-Net-based segmentation.
